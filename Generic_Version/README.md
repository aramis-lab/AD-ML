This directory contains the guidelines and steps to generic experiments for Alzheimerâ€™s disease classification from clinical and 
neuroimaging data. The data is obtained from [ADNI](http://adni.loni.usc.edu/) dataset. 
It is developed by the [ARAMIS Lab](http://www.aramislab.fr).

We assume that you have installed all the dependencies of [Clinica software platform](http://www.clinica.run)

# Ensure that you have installed the latest released version of Clinica
Please follow carefully the steps for the installation of Clinica, present in the documentation available at: https://github.com/aramis-lab/AD-ML/wiki

We suggest to use an isolated Conda environment to avoid conflicts with previous versions of libraries 
already installed in your computer.
